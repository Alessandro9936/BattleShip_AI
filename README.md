# BattleShip_AI

This is a project from my Odin curriculum, it's fun and engaging battleship game against a computer capable to make random plays.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## What I Learned

This has been a really challenging project and required me longer time than the others since I implemented for the first time unit testing and TDD using a 'build logic first' approach. Building logic first means to implement all the logic of the game and the connection between components without having an user interface, the only way to understand if your are doing things right is the response coming from tests.
